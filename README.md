üìä Overview
This Power BI project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline, from ETL to visualization. It uses data from a sales database (SQLite) and presents interactive insights in a Power BI dashboard.


üß† SQL Queries & Reports
Top Customers
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT c.name, SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_spent
FROM sale s
JOIN customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
This query aggregates total sales per customer and ranks them by spending.

Sales Trends Over Time
Date fields were extracted in Power BI:

Year

Quarter

Month

These were used to build a drillable time series chart.

üìê Dashboard Design Choices
Slicer: Enables filtering by product category.

Bar Chart: Shows top customers by total sales.

Line Chart: Displays sales trends across time (year ‚Üí quarter ‚Üí month).

Matrix: Slices data by product and region.

## Final Dashboard

Color choices were kept consistent for clarity. Charts were positioned logically: slicers on the left, visuals on the right.

üîó Data Model / Schema
Spark SQL Schema or Power BI Model View

Your Power BI data model showing relationships between tables.

‚úÖ Query Results

Output of the Top Customers SQL query.

üñ•Ô∏è Final Dashboard / Charts

Fully interactive Power BI dashboard with drilldowns and slicers.

‚úÖ Steps Taken:
Connected to the SmartSalesDSN ODBC Data Source

Used the built-in Odbc.DataSource function in Power BI to connect to the existing SmartSalesDSN.

Created a Native SQL Query

Wrote a custom SQL query using Value.NativeQuery to join the sale and product tables.

Aggregated total sales (SUM(s.sale_amount)) by product_name.

Sorted the results in descending order to highlight top-selling products first.

Loaded the Query into Power BI

Loaded the result set into Power BI as a new table.

Used it to generate visualizations such as bar charts or tables showing top-performing products.
